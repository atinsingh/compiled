Since the courses are quite technical and require hands on training and labs, I was fortunate to have a good instructor (Harun) who is very knowledgeable, and has a passion in this subject. He goes out of his way to make sure you thoroughly understand the concepts and will make sure nobody gets left behind.  This is what sets Pragra apart; their trainers are like leaders and the staff strive to be better by delivering on small things that matter.
